# Alternative Wave
## under development

### A small music application that I've created when I was still learning Vue. As a huge fan of alternative music, I wanted to promote small musicians that want to get more of the publicity. If you want to get a shout out - PM ME! The list will get updated very soon, as well as the application!
In the future, I would love to create a full service that would offer a platform to alternative artists.
