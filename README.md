# music-app
## under development

### A small music application that I've created when I was still learning Vue. I really wanted to learn the basic concepts of this framework, hence I decided to create something rather compact - big projects incoming ;);) 

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
